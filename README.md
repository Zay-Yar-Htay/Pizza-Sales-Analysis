## Project Overview
This is Plato's Pizza Place Sales dataset provided by Maven Analytics which contains 48,620 sales records with multiple table structures (4 Tables).

**Introduction:**
In this project, we aimed to analyze a dataset using MySQL for database operations, including data inspection, manipulation, and retrieval, followed by deep analysis using Power BI for visualization and the creation of interactive reports. The project involved several key steps, including database setup, data exploration, feature engineering, and visualization to derive actionable insights.

**Objectives:**
1. Setup MySQL database: Create a database environment to store and manage the dataset efficiently.
2. Data inspection: Explore the dataset to understand its structure, content, and relationships between different tables.
3. Feature engineering: Enhance the dataset by adding new columns or transforming existing ones to facilitate deeper analysis.
4. Data retrieval: Extract relevant data from the database to perform analysis and visualization.
5. Deep analysis: Utilize Power BI to visualize the dataset, identify trends, patterns, and correlations, and derive actionable insights.
6. Interactive reporting: Create interactive reports in Power BI to communicate findings effectively and enable stakeholders to explore the data dynamically.

**Methodology:**
1. Database Setup:
* Install and configure MySQL database server.
* Create a new database and tables to store the dataset.
* Import the dataset into MySQL tables.

2. Data Inspection:
* Use SQL queries to inspect the data, including table structures, data types, and sample records.
* Identify any missing or inconsistent data that may require cleaning or preprocessing.

3. Feature Engineering:
* Add new columns to the dataset based on domain knowledge or analytical requirements.
* Perform data transformations, such as normalization, aggregation, or categorical encoding, to prepare the data for analysis.

4. Data Retrieval:
* Write SQL queries to extract relevant data subsets for analysis.
* Join multiple tables if necessary to combine related information.

5. Deep Analysis:
* Connect Power BI to the MySQL database to access the data.
* Design visually appealing and informative charts, graphs, and dashboards to explore the dataset.
* Apply statistical analysis, trend analysis, and correlation analysis to uncover insights.

6. Interactive Reporting:
* Create interactive reports in Power BI using the visualizations generated in the previous step.
* Add filters, slicers, and drill-down capabilities to enable users to interact with the data dynamically.
* Publish the reports to a shared workspace or online platform for easy access by stakeholders.

**Results:**
* The MySQL database was successfully set up, and the dataset was imported for analysis.
* Data inspection revealed insights into the structure and content of the dataset, guiding further analysis.
* Feature engineering improved the dataset's suitability for deep analysis by adding relevant columns and transforming data.
* Data retrieval queries effectively extracted subsets of data for analysis.
* Power BI visualizations provided meaningful insights into the dataset, including trends, patterns, and correlations.
* Interactive reports empowered stakeholders to explore the data dynamically and derive actionable insights for decision-making.

## Business Questions
1. How many customers do we have each day? Are there any peak hours? 
2. How many pizzas are typically in an order? Do we have any bestsellers?
3. How much money did we make this year? Can we indentify any seasonality in the sales?
4. Are there any pizzas we should take of the menu, or any promotions we could leverage?

## Insights and Recommendation
* **July Reigns Supreme**: Looking back at 2015, July emerged as our top-performing month, followed closely by May, March, and November. Meanwhile, October saw the lowest revenue figures.
* **Busiest Hours**: Lunchtime, particularly 12:00 PM to 2:00 PM, sees the highest order volumes on weekdays, emphasizing lunch breaks as peak ordering times.
* **Weekday Patterns**: Mondays and Wednesdays mirror this trend, showing consistent midday orders, gradually decreasing towards evenings.
* **Weekend Behavior**: Saturdays and Sundays exhibit lower lunchtime orders compared to weekdays, but an uptick in dinner orders suggests popular social gatherings.
* **Late-Night Orders**: Late-night orders are minimal, highlighting pizza's association with daytime and evening dining over late-night snacking.
* **Bestseller Spotlight**: "The Classic Deluxe Pizza" shines as a top performer, winning the hearts of our customers with its delicious blend of flavors.
* **Under-Performing Slice**: On the flip side, "The Brie Carre Pizza" has struggled to make an impact, indicating a potential candidate for menu reevaluation or promotional efforts.
* **Next Step**: Leveraging the success of our bestsellers, we can consider highlighting them in promotions and marketing campaigns to drive sales. Additionally, assessing the appeal and sales potential of under-performing pizzas like "The Brie Carre Pizza" can guide decisions regarding menu adjustments or targeted promotions to boost their visibility and appeal.

**Pizza Category Insights**
* **Classic Takes the Lead**: Classic pizzas lead both in revenue and total units sold, indicating strong popularity among customers.
* **Veggie and Supreme Follow**: Veggie and Supreme pizzas trail behind Classic, showcasing consistent performance in both revenue and sales.
* **Chicken Trails Behind**: Chicken pizzas, while still contributing to sales, have the lowest revenue and sales volume among all categories.

**Pizza Size Analysis**
* **Large Pizzas Reign**: Large pizzas dominate both in revenue and total units sold, reflecting strong demand for this size.
* **Medium Follows Suit**: Medium-sized pizzas are the second most popular choice, generating substantial revenue and sales.
* **Limited Demand for Larger Sizes**: Extra Large and Double Extra Large pizzas have lower revenue and sales volume, suggesting a lesser demand for larger-sized pizzas.
