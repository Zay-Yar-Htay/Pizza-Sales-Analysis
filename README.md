## Insights and Recommendation
* July Reigns Supreme: Looking back at 2015, July emerged as our top-performing month, followed closely by May, March, and November. Meanwhile, October saw the lowest revenue figures.
* Busiest Hours: Lunchtime, particularly 12:00 PM to 2:00 PM, sees the highest order volumes on weekdays, emphasizing lunch breaks as peak ordering times.
* Weekday Patterns: Mondays and Wednesdays mirror this trend, showing consistent midday orders, gradually decreasing towards evenings.
* Weekend Behavior: Saturdays and Sundays exhibit lower lunchtime orders compared to weekdays, but an uptick in dinner orders suggests popular social gatherings.
* Late Night Orders: Late-night orders are minimal, highlighting pizza's association with daytime and evening dining over late-night snacking.
* Bestseller Spotlight: "The Classic Deluxe Pizza" shines as a top performer, winning the hearts of our customers with its delicious blend of flavors.
* Under-Performing Slice: On the flip side, "The Brie Carre Pizza" has struggled to make an impact, indicating a potential candidate for menu reevaluation or promotional efforts.
* Next Step: Leveraging the success of our bestsellers, we can consider highlighting them in promotions and marketing campaigns to drive sales. Additionally, assessing the appeal and sales potential of under-performing pizzas like "The Brie Carre Pizza" can guide decisions regarding menu adjustments or targeted promotions to boost their visibility and appeal.
